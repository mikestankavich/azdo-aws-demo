# Video Script Outline

## Loom Technical Walkthrough (10-15 minutes)

### Opening Hook (30 seconds)
**Script:**
"Hi, I'm Mike Stankavich, and I want to show you something that took me about 4 hours to build but demonstrates enterprise-grade CI/CD patterns that typically take teams weeks to implement. This is a complete zero-to-production platform using Azure DevOps pipelines with AWS infrastructure, all provisioned through Infrastructure as Code."

**Visual:** GitHub repository overview showing clean structure

### Problem Statement (1 minute)
**Script:**
"The challenge I set for myself was: how do you demonstrate sophisticated DevOps practices - specifically Azure DevOps integration with AWS, advanced Terraform patterns, and production-ready CI/CD pipelines - in a way that shows both technical depth and enterprise thinking?"

**Visual:** Architecture diagram showing three-repository strategy

### Solution Architecture (2 minutes)
**Script:**
"My approach uses a three-repository strategy that mirrors real enterprise patterns. First, account provisioning that creates the foundation. Second, bootstrap infrastructure for shared modules and team setup. Third, the actual application delivery with sophisticated pipelines."

**Visual:**
- Repository structure walkthrough
- Mermaid architecture diagram
- Technology stack overview

### Technical Deep Dive - Bootstrap (3 minutes)
**Script:**
"Let me show you the bootstrap process. This isn't just running terraform apply - this is creating AWS IAM roles, Azure DevOps projects, state backends, and service connections, all from a single command."

**Visual:**
- Show `just bootstrap` command execution
- AWS console showing created IAM roles
- Azure DevOps projects being created
- Terraform Cloud workspace

### Technical Deep Dive - CI/CD Pipeline (4 minutes)
**Script:**
"Here's where it gets interesting. The pipeline has security scanning, multi-stage deployments, approval workflows, and automated rollback capabilities. Watch what happens when I make a code change."

**Visual:**
- Azure DevOps pipeline overview
- Live pipeline execution
- Security gates in action
- Approval workflow demonstration
- Application deployment

### Application Demonstration (2 minutes)
**Script:**
"The end result is a production-ready Next.js application deployed to ECS with SSL certificates, health checks, and semantic versioning. But more importantly, look at the operational capabilities."

**Visual:**
- Working application in browser
- Health check endpoints
- Version information
- CloudWatch logs and monitoring

### Platform Engineering Vision (2 minutes)
**Script:**
"This demonstrates patterns that scale to self-service developer platforms. Imagine developers saying 'create me a new microservice with Redis and PostgreSQL' and getting this entire infrastructure pattern, customized for their needs, in minutes."

**Visual:**
- Shared module examples
- Template-driven possibilities
- Scaling considerations diagram

### Wrap-up and Next Steps (1 minute)
**Script:**
"What you've seen represents about 4 hours of focused development, but demonstrates enterprise patterns that typically take much longer to implement. The code is all available on GitHub, and I've documented the architectural decisions and platform engineering potential."

**Visual:**
- GitHub repository
- Documentation overview
- Contact information

## LinkedIn Highlight Reel (2-3 minutes)

### Hook (15 seconds)
**Script:**
"4 hours. That's how long it took to build a complete enterprise CI/CD platform with Azure DevOps and AWS. Here's what's possible when you combine Infrastructure as Code with thoughtful automation."

### Quick Demo (90 seconds)
**Visual-Heavy:**
- Fast-paced montage of:
    - `just bootstrap` command
    - Pipeline execution
    - Application deployment
    - Architecture diagrams

### Value Proposition (30 seconds)
**Script:**
"This isn't just a demo - it's a foundation for self-service developer platforms. The patterns here scale to enterprise-grade platform engineering."

### Call to Action (15 seconds)
**Script:**
"Full walkthrough and code available on GitHub. What would you build with patterns like these?"

## Script Writing Tips

### Key Messaging Themes
1. **Enterprise Readiness** - This isn't toy code, it's production patterns
2. **Platform Thinking** - Shows vision beyond just CI/CD
3. **Practical Implementation** - Real working code, not just concepts
4. **Scalable Patterns** - Foundation for larger initiatives

### Technical Credibility Builders
- Show actual working systems
- Explain architectural trade-offs
- Demonstrate debugging/troubleshooting
- Reference industry best practices

### Engagement Techniques
- Start with hooks that create curiosity
- Use visual demonstrations over talking heads
- Break complex topics into digestible segments
- End with clear calls to action

### Production Notes
- **Screen Recording:** Use high resolution, clean desktop
- **Audio:** Clear microphone, quiet environment
- **Pacing:** Pause between major sections
- **Editing:** Keep transitions smooth, remove "ums" and long pauses
- **Graphics:** Use arrows and highlights to guide attention

### Adaptation Guidelines
- **Loom:** More conversational, like explaining to a colleague
- **LinkedIn:** High energy, business value focused
- **YouTube:** Educational, comprehensive, SEO optimized
- **Technical Audience:** Show more code, explain decisions
- **Business Audience:** Focus on outcomes and platform vision
